# LabWiki

This demo/test wiki is part of my ongoing effort to clean up and release my lab
code. I've been keeping an electronic lab notebook for several years now, and
have tried a few formats and workflows with varying degrees of success. I think
it's finally reached the point where it works well enough to be worth sharing.

So far it's a very hands-on environment appropriate for the type of people who
have a favorite text editor and like to keep things in version control, rather
than a general science/research audience. I considered trying to "fix" that,
but decided research is about the process and I should just document what
worked for me. Personally, I find that simplicity and flexibility make up for
the lack of a polished interface. The most important thing is you'll be able to
change it to match your requirements later!

In that same spirit, I'll be keeping a "dev notebook" here that explains how to
build up the wiki feature by feature as I factor them out of the existing
unpublished/undocumented codebase. Hopefully that will clarify, simplify, and
force me to finish some pull requests.

Here's a tentative list of things to include:

01. [Gitit](notebook/2017-03-05_gitit/readme.md)
02. ~~Notebook section~~
03. ~~Git-annex and syncing~~
04. Wiki section
05. Database section
06. Nix packages
07. CSV Plugin
08. Citation plugins and Zotero integration
09. Files plugin
10. Ace editor
11. RMarkdown plugin
12. Dot plugin
13. Printing pages
14. Demo site
15. Sandbox
