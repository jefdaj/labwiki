title: LabWiki
...

This demo/test wiki is part of my ongoing effort to clean up and release my lab
code. I've been keeping an electronic lab notebook for several years now, and
have tried a few formats and workflows with varying degrees of success. I think
it's finally reached the point where it works well enough to be worth sharing.

So far it's a very hands-on environment appropriate for the type of people who
have a favorite text editor and like to keep things in version control, rather
than a general science/research audience. I considered trying to "fix" that,
but decided research is about the process and I should just document what
worked for me. Personally, I find that simplicity and flexibility make up for
the lack of a polished interface. The most important thing is you'll be able to
change it to match your requirements later!

In that same spirit, I'll be keeping a "dev notebook" here that explains how to
build up the wiki feature by feature as I factor them out of the existing
unpublished/undocumented codebase. Hopefully that will clarify, simplify, and
force me to finish some pull requests.

Here's a tentative list of things to include:

#. ~~Gitit~~
#. ~~Notebook section~~
#. Git-annex and syncing
#. Wiki section
#. Database section
#. Nix packages
#. CSV Plugin
#. Citation plugins and Zotero integration
#. Files plugin
#. Ace editor
#. RMarkdown plugin
#. Dot plugin
#. Printing pages
#. Demo site
#. Sandbox
